# Scripts

A central repository for sharing reusable configurations, scripts, and parameter templates across multiple projects. Instead of reinventing the wheel each time, you can quickly grab the files you need and adapt them to your current environment.

## Purpose

- **Consolidation**: Store all frequently used Docker Compose snippets, shell scripts, configuration templates, and “useful parameters” in one place.  
- **Reusability**: Enable team members (and your future self) to copy, modify, or reference these assets instead of writing them from scratch.  
- **Consistency**: Promote standardized patterns and best practices for common tasks (e.g., deploying Kafka in KRaft mode, initializing topics, setting up CI/CD pipelines).

## Repository Layout

- **configs/**:  
  - Docker Compose files (e.g., Kafka KRaft setup, reverse-proxy configurations).  
  - Kubernetes YAML templates (deployments, ingresses).  
  - CI/CD examples (GitHub Actions, Jenkins pipelines).

- **scripts/**:  
  - Small, self-contained shell (or Python) scripts to automate recurring tasks (backups, deployments, health checks).  
  - Each script includes a header comment describing its purpose, usage, and dependencies.

- **parameters/**:  
  - Example environment-variable templates (e.g., `.env.example`).  
  - Collections of commonly used tuning flags (Java JVM settings, database connection parameters).

## How to Use

1. **Clone this repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Scripts.git
   cd Scripts
